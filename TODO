Open issues:

-- attributes are neither type-checked nor set into the instances, and
   there is no mechanism to recover them and use them.

-- defaults are neither type-checked nor set.

-- structural constraints are neither typechecked nor stored

-- test-executions, test-results, and their entire management
   inside DOF is very unclear.

-- Hovering over doc-class references is not implemented

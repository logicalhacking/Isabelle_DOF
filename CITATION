	abstract  = {While Isabelle is mostly known as part of Isabelle/HOL (an 
                     interactive theorem prover), it actually provides a framework
                     for developing a wide spectrum of applications. A particular 
                     strength of the Isabelle framework is the combination of text 
                     editing, formal verification, and code generation.\\\\
                     Up to now, Isabelle's document preparation system lacks a mechanism 
                     for ensuring the structure of different document types (as, e.g.,
                     required in certification processes) in general and, in particular,
                     mechanism for linking informal and formal parts of a document.\\\\
                     In this paper, we present Isabelle/DOF, a novel Document Ontology 
                     Framework on top of Isabelle. Isabelle/DOF allows for conventional 
                     typesetting \emph{as well} as formal development. We show how to model 
                     document ontologies inside Isabelle/DOF, how to use the resulting 
                     meta-information for enforcing a certain document structure, and discuss 
                     ontology-specific IDE support.},

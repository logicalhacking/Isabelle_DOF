# Isabelle_DOF: Document Preparation Setup

This directory contains the LaTeX setup for Isabelle's 
document generation system. 


## Tipps

During debugging of LaTeX errors, it can be very helpful to use 
more than 79 characters for error messages (otherwise, long errors
are truncated)"
``` bash
max_print_line=200 error_line=200 half_error_line=100  pdflatex root.tex
```

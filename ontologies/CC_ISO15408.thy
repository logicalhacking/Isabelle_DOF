chapter \<open>An Outline of a Common Criteria Ontology\<close>

text{* NOTE: An Ontology-Model of a certification standard such as Comon Criteria or
Common Criteria (ISO15408) identifies:
- notions (conceptual \emph{categories}) having \emph{instances}
  (similar to classes and objects),
- their subtype relation (eg., a "security target" is a "requirement definition"),
- their syntactical structure 
  (for the moment: defined by regular expressions describing the
   order of category instances in the overall document as a regular language)

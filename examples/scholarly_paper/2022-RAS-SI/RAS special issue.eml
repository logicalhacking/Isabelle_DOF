Hi Bu,

Hope all is well with you.  Long time, no talk.

As part of my work with the Royal Academy of Engineering, I have been
promoting Software Engineering for Robotics as an important and relevant
research topic.  Recently, colleagues in RoboStar  and I have successfully
proposed a special issue of Elsevier's Robotics and Autonomous Systems
journal: https://www.journals.elsevier.com/robotics-and-autonomous-systems.
This is a journal that has published next to no papers in Software
Engineering, so I see this as an excellent opportunity for us to expand the
visibility of our work.

I'm writing to ask you for your help with this.  We do not think that the
RoboStar team at York should submit papers due to the obvious conflict of
interest.  So, I need the community's support. The prospect is publishing
up to 15 papers (or more).  So, what do we ask?

1. Consider submitting a paper:  the deadline is 30 April, 2022;
2. Spread the word in your group, department, and wider network.

The Call for Papers can be found at
https://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/CfP-ROBOT-2022.html.  It is also reproduced
below for convenience.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.

Many thanks in advance,

Ana

# Special Issue: Software Engineering for Robotics # Robotics and
Autonomous Systems Journal, Elsevier

We invite submissions of papers on Software Engineering for Robotics for
publication in a special issue of Robotics and Autonomous Systems (
https://www.journals.elsevier.com/robotics-and-autonomous-systems).

## Scope

This special issue is devoted to original research papers on techniques,
applications, industrial case studies, and experience reports connected to
the design and deployment of software for robotic systems. Focus is given
on all aspects of modelling, simulation, and implementation for the
validation and verification of robotic systems.

## Topics of Interest

In particular, the topics of interest include but are not limited to
 * Domain-specific languages for robotics
 * Verification of robotic applications: simulation, testing, and deploymen=
t
 * Requirements analysis and validation of robotic applications
 * Hybrid modelling and analysis of robotics applications
 * Probabilistic models and analysis for robotic applications
 * Approaches to safety and security of robotic applications
 * Software development processes and methods for robotics
 * Robotic system maintenance, adaptation, and evolution

## Submission Format and Guideline

Papers should be submitted via the online submission system Editorial
Manager=C2=AE (https://www.editorialmanager.com/robot/default1.aspx) for th=
e
journal. There is a Guide for Authors (
https://www.elsevier.com/journals/robotics-and-autonomous-systems/0921-8890=
/guide-for-authors),
where you=E2=80=99ll find LaTeX templates.  Use of LaTeX is recommended.

All papers will be peer-reviewed by three independent reviewers. Requests
for additional information should be addressed to the guest editors.

## Important dates

* Submission deadline: 30.04.2022
* Acceptance deadline: 30.11.2022

## Guest editors

* Ana Cavalcanti, University of York
* Alvaro Miyazawa, University of York
* Jon Timmis, University of Sunderland

     The system architecture of Isabelle (left-hand side) and the 
     asynchronous communication between the Isabelle system and 
     the IDE (right-hand side). \<close>

text\<open>This cookbook roughly follows the Isabelle system architecture shown in 
  @{figure "architecture"}, and, to be more precise, more or less in the bottom-up order.

  We start from the basic underlying SML platform over the Kernels to the tactical layer 
  and end with a discussion over the front-end technologies.
\<close>

chapter*[t1::technical]\<open> SML and Fundamental SML libraries  \<close>    

section*[t11::technical] "ML, Text and Antiquotations"

text\<open>Isabelle is written in SML, the "Standard Meta-Language", which is is an impure functional 
  programming language allowing, in principle, mutable variables and side-effects. 
  The following Isabelle/Isar commands allow for accessing the underlying SML interpreter
  of Isabelle directly. In the example, a mutable variable X is declared, defined to 0 and updated; 
  and finally re-evaluated leading to output: \<close>

ML\<open> val X = Unsynchronized.ref 0;
    X:= !X + 1;
    X
  \<close>

text\<open>However, since Isabelle is a platform involving parallel execution, concurrent computing, and,
  as an interactive environment, involves backtracking / re-evaluation as a consequence of user-
  interaction, imperative programming is discouraged and nearly never used in the entire Isabelle
  code-base @{cite "DBLP:conf/mkm/BarrasGHRTWW13"}.
  The preferred programming style is purely functional: \<close>

ML\<open> fun fac x = if x = 0 then 1 else x * fac(x-1) ;
    fac 10;
  \<close>
(* or *) 
ML\<open> type state = {  a : int,   b : string}
    fun incr_state ({a, b}:state) =  {a=a+1, b=b}
  \<close>

text\<open> The faculty function is defined and executed; the (sub)-interpreter in Isar
  works in the conventional read-execute-print loop for each statement separated by a ";".
  Functions, types, data-types etc. can be grouped to modules (called \<^emph>\<open>structures\<close>) which can
  be constrained to interfaces (called \<^emph>\<open>signatures\<close>) and even be parametric structures
  (called \<^emph>\<open>functors\<close>). \<close>

text\<open> The Isabelle/Isar interpreter (called \<^emph>\<open>toplevel\<close> ) is extensible; by a mixture of SML
  and Isar-commands, domain-specific components can be developed and integrated into the system 
  on the fly. Actually, the Isabelle system code-base consists mainly of SML and \<^verbatim>\<open>.thy\<close>-files 
  containing such mixtures of Isar commands and SML. \<close>

text\<open> Besides the ML-command used in the above examples, there are a number of commands 
  representing text-elements in Isabelle/Isar; text commands can be interleaved arbitraryly
  with other commands. Text in text-commands may use LaTeX and is used for type-setting 
  documentations in a kind of literate programming style. \<close>

text\<open>So: the text command for:\<close>

text\<open>\<^emph>\<open>This is a text.\<close>\<close>

text\<open>... is represented in an \<^verbatim>\<open>.thy\<close> file by:\<close>

text\<open>\verb+text\<open>\<^emph>\<open>This is a text.\<close>\<close>+\<close>

text\<open>and desplayed in the Isabelle/jedit front-end at the sceen by:\<close>

figure*[fig2::figure, relative_width="100",src="''figures/text-element''"]
        \<open>A text-element as presented in Isabelle/jedit.\<close>

text\<open> text-commands, ML- commands (and in principle any other command) can be seen as 
  \<^emph>\<open>quotations\<close> over the underlying SML environment (similar to OCaml or Haskell).
  Linking these different sorts of quotations with each other and the underlying SML-envirnment
  is supported via \<^emph>\<open>antiquotations\<close>'s. Generally speaking, antiquotations are a programming 
  technique to specify expressions or patterns in a quotation, parsed in the context of the 
  enclosing expression or pattern where the quotation is. Another way to understand this concept:
  anti-quotations are "semantic macros" that produce a value for the surrounding context
  (ML, text, HOL, whatever) depending on local arguments and the underlying logical context.
  
  The way an antiquotation is specified depends on the quotation expander: typically a specific 
  character and an identifier, or specific parentheses and a complete expression or pattern.\<close>

text\<open> In Isabelle documentations, antiquotation's were heavily used to enrich literate explanations
  and documentations by "formal content", i.e. machine-checked, typed references
  to all sorts of entities in the context of the interpreting environment. 
  Formal content allows for coping with sources that rapidly evolve and were developed by 
  distributed teams as is typical in open-source developments. 
  A paradigmatic example for antiquotation in Texts and Program snippets is here:\<close>

text\<open> @{footnote \<open>sdf\<close>}, @{file "$ISABELLE_HOME/src/Pure/ROOT.ML"}\<close> 
ML\<open>    val x = @{thm refl};
       val y = @{term "A \<longrightarrow> B"}
       val y = @{typ  "'a list"}
  \<close>

text\<open>... which we will describe in more detail later. \<close> 

text\<open>In a way, literate specification attempting to maximize its formal content is a way to
  ensure "Agile Development" in a (theory)-document development, at least for its objectives, 
  albeit not for its popular methods and processes like SCRUM. \<close>

paragraph\<open>
  A maximum of formal content inside text documentation also ensures the 
  consistency of this present text with the underlying Isabelle version.\<close>

section\<open>The Isabelle/Pure bootstrap\<close>

text\<open>It is instructive to study the fundamental bootstrapping sequence of the Isabelle system;
  it is written in the Isar format and gives an idea of the global module dependencies: 
  @{file "$ISABELLE_HOME/src/Pure/ROOT.ML"}. Loading this file 
  (for example by hovering over this hyperlink in the antiquotation holding control or
  command key in Isabelle/jedit and activating it) allows the Isabelle IDE 
  to support hyperlinking \<^emph>\<open>inside\<close> the Isabelle source.\<close>

text\<open>The bootstrapping sequence is also reflected in the following diagram @{figure "architecture"}.\<close>


section*[t12::technical] "Elements of the SML library";  
text\<open>Elements of the @{file "$ISABELLE_HOME/src/Pure/General/basics.ML"} SML library
  are basic exceptions. Note that exceptions should be catched individually, uncatched exceptions 
  except those generated by the specific "error" function are discouraged in Isabelle
  source programming since they might produce races. Finally, a number of commonly
  used "squigglish" combinators is listed:\<close>

ML\<open>   Bind      : exn;
      Chr       : exn;
      Div       : exn;
      Domain    : exn;
      Fail      : string -> exn;
      Match     : exn;
      Overflow  : exn;
      Size      : exn;
      Span      : exn;
      Subscript : exn;
     
      exnName : exn -> string ; (* -- very interesting to query an unknown exception  *)
      exnMessage : exn -> string ;\<close>

ML\<open>
op ! : 'a Unsynchronized.ref -> 'a;
op := : ('a Unsynchronized.ref * 'a) -> unit;

op #> :  ('a -> 'b) * ('b -> 'c) -> 'a -> 'c; (* reversed function composition *)
op o : (('b -> 'c) * ('a -> 'b)) -> 'a -> 'c;
op |-- : ('a -> 'b * 'c) * ('c -> 'd * 'e) -> 'a -> 'd * 'e;
op --| : ('a -> 'b * 'c) * ('c -> 'd * 'e) -> 'a -> 'b * 'e;
op -- : ('a -> 'b * 'c) * ('c -> 'd * 'e) -> 'a -> ('b * 'd) * 'e;
op ? : bool * ('a -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'a;
ignore: 'a -> unit;
op before : ('a * unit) -> 'a;
I: 'a -> 'a;
K: 'a -> 'b -> 'a
\<close> 

text\<open>Some basic examples for the programming style using these combinators can be found in the
  "The Isabelle Cookbook" section 2.3.\<close>

text\<open>An omnipresent data-structure in the Isabelle SML sources are tables
  implemented in @{file "$ISABELLE_HOME/src/Pure/General/table.ML"}. These 
  generic tables are presented in an efficient purely functional implementation using
  balanced 2-3 trees. Key operations are:\<close>
ML\<open>
signature TABLE_reduced =
sig
  type key
  type 'a table
  exception DUP of key
  exception SAME
  exception UNDEF of key
  val empty: 'a table
  val dest: 'a table -> (key * 'a) list
  val keys: 'a table -> key list
  val lookup_key: 'a table -> key -> (key * 'a) option
  val lookup: 'a table -> key -> 'a option
  val defined: 'a table -> key -> bool
  val update: key * 'a -> 'a table -> 'a table
  (* ... *)
end
\<close>
text\<open>... where \<^verbatim>\<open>key\<close> is usually just a synonym for string.\<close>

chapter*[t2::technical] \<open>  Prover Architecture \<close>

section*[t21::technical] \<open>  The Nano-Kernel: Contexts,  (Theory)-Contexts, (Proof)-Contexts \<close>

text\<open> What I call the 'Nano-Kernel' in Isabelle can also be seen as an acyclic theory graph.
  The meat of it can be found in the file @{file "$ISABELLE_HOME/src/Pure/context.ML"}. 
  My notion is a bit criticisable since this component, which provides the type of @{ML_type theory}
  and @{ML_type Proof.context},  is not that Nano after all.
  However, these type are pretty empty place-holders at that level and the content of
  @{file  "$ISABELLE_HOME/src/Pure/theory.ML"} is registered much later.
  The sources themselves mention it as "Fundamental Structure".
  In principle, theories and proof contexts could be REGISTERED as user data inside contexts.
  The chosen specialization is therefore an acceptable meddling of the abstraction "Nano-Kernel"
  and its application context: Isabelle.
  
  Makarius himself says about this structure:
  
  "Generic theory contexts with unique identity, arbitrarily typed data,
  monotonic development graph and history support.  Generic proof
  contexts with arbitrarily typed data."
  
  In my words: a context is essentially a container with
  \<^item> an id
  \<^item> a list of parents (so: the graph structure)
  \<^item> a time stamp and
  \<^item> a sub-context relation (which uses a combination of the id and the time-stamp to
    establish this relation very fast whenever needed; it plays a crucial role for the
    context transfer in the kernel.
  
  
  A context comes in form of three 'flavours':
  \<^item> theories : @{ML_type theory}'s, containing a syntax and axioms, but also
               user-defined data and configuration information.
  \<^item> Proof-Contexts:  @{ML_type Proof.context} 
               containing theories but also additional information if Isar goes into prove-mode.
               In general a richer structure than theories coping also with fixes, facts, goals,
               in order to support the structured Isar proof-style.
  \<^item> Generic:  @{ML_type Context.generic }, i.e. the sum of both.
  
  All context have to be seen as mutable; so there are usually transformations defined on them
  which are possible as long as a particular protocol (\<^verbatim>\<open>begin_thy\<close> - \<^verbatim>\<open>end_thy\<close> etc) are respected.
  
  Contexts come with type user-defined data which is mutable through the entire lifetime of
  a context.

subsection*[t213::example]\<open>Mechanism 2 : Extending the Global Context $\theta$ by User Data \<close>

text\<open>A central mechanism for constructing user-defined data is by the \<^verbatim>\<open>Generic_Data\<close> SML functor.
  A plugin needing some data \<^verbatim>\<open>T\<close> and providing it with implementations for an 
  \<^verbatim>\<open>empty\<close>, and operations  \<^verbatim>\<open>merge\<close> and \<^verbatim>\<open>extend\<close>, can construct a lense with operations
  \<^verbatim>\<open>get\<close> and \<^verbatim>\<open>put\<close> that attach this data into the generic system context. Rather than using
  unsynchronized SML mutable variables, this is the mechanism to introduce component local
  data in Isabelle, which allows to manage this data for the necessary backtrack- and synchronization
  features in the pervasively parallel evaluation framework that Isabelle as a system represents.\<close>

ML \<open>
datatype X = mt
val init = mt;
val ext = I
fun merge (X,Y) = mt

structure Data = Generic_Data
(
  type T = X
  val empty  = init
  val extend = ext
  val merge  = merge
);  


 Data.get : Context.generic -> Data.T;
 Data.put : Data.T -> Context.generic -> Context.generic;
 Data.map : (Data.T -> Data.T) -> Context.generic -> Context.generic;
 (* there are variants to do this on theories ... *)

text\<open>This core-data structure of the Isabelle Kernel is accessible in the Isabelle/ML environment
and serves as basis for programmed extensions concerning syntax, type-checking, and advanced
tactic programming over kernel primitives and higher API's. There are a number of anti-quotations
giving support for this task; since @{ML Const}-names are long-names revealing information
of the potentially evolving library structure, the use of anti-quotations leads to a safer programming
style of tactics and became therefore standard in the entire Isabelle code-base.
\<close>

text\<open>The following examples show how term- and type-level antiquotations are used and that
     they can both be used for term-construction as well as term-destruction (pattern-matching):\<close>

ML\<open> val Const ("HOL.implies", @{typ "bool \<Rightarrow> bool \<Rightarrow> bool"}) 
              $ Free ("A", @{typ "bool"}) 
              $ Free ("B", @{typ "bool"}) 
        = @{term "A \<longrightarrow> B"};

 val "HOL.bool" = @{type_name "bool"};

 (* three ways to write type bool:@ *)
 val Type("fun",[s,Type("fun",[@{typ "bool"},Type(@{type_name "bool"},[])])]) = @{typ "bool \<Rightarrow> bool \<Rightarrow> bool"};
 
\<close>

text\<open>Note that the SML interpreter is configured that he will actually print a type
     \<^verbatim>\<open>Type("HOL.bool",[])\<close> just as \<^verbatim>\<open>"bool": typ\<close>, so a compact notation looking
     pretty much like a string. This can be confusing at times.\<close>

text\<open>Note, furthermore, that there is a programming API for the HOL-instance of Isabelle:
  it is contained in @{file  "$ISABELLE_HOME/src/HOL/Tools/hologic.ML"}. It offers for many
  operators of the HOL logic specific constructors and destructors:\<close>

  @{ML "Sign.typ_match"} etc. is actually an abstract wrapper on the structure

text\<open> Type generalization --- the conversion between free type variables and schematic

subsection*[t237::technical]\<open>Constructing Terms without Type-Inference\<close>
text\<open>Using @{ML "Type_Infer_Context.infer_types"} is not quite unproblematic: since the type
inference can construct types for largely underspecified terms, it may happen that under 
some circumstances, tactics and proof-attempts fail since just some internal term representation
was too general. A more defensive strategy is already sketched --- but neither explicitely 
mentioned nor worked out in the interface in @{ML_structure HOLogic}. The idea is to have
advanced term constructors that construct the right term from the leaves, which were by convention
fully type-annotated (so: this does not work for terms with dangling @(ML Bound)'s).

Operations like  @{ML "HOLogic.mk_prod"} or @{ML "HOLogic.mk_fst"}  or  @{ML "HOLogic.mk_eq"} do
exactly this by using an internal pure bottom-up type-inference  @{ML "fastype_of"}.
The following routines are written in the same style complement the existing API

section*[t26::technical]\<open>Advanced Specification Constructs\<close>
text\<open>Isabelle is built around the idea that system components were built on top
of the kernel in order to give the user high-level specification constructs 
--- rather than inside as in the Coq kernel that foresees, for example, data-types
and primitive recursors already in the basic $\lambda$-term language.
Therefore, records, definitions, type-definitions, recursive function definitions
are supported by packages that belong to the \<^emph>\<open>components\<close> strata. 
With the exception of the @{ML "Specification.axiomatization"} construct, they
are all-together built as composition of conservative extensions.

The components are a bit scattered in the architecture. A relatively recent and
high-level component (more low-level components such as @{ML "Global_Theory.add_defs"}
exist) for definitions and axiomatizations is here:
\<close>


ML\<open>
local open Specification
  val _= definition: (binding * typ option * mixfix) option ->
        (binding * typ option * mixfix) list -> term list -> Attrib.binding * term ->
        local_theory -> (term * (string * thm)) * local_theory
  val _= definition': (binding * typ option * mixfix) option ->
        (binding * typ option * mixfix) list ->  term list -> Attrib.binding * term ->
        bool -> local_theory -> (term * (string * thm)) * local_theory
  val _= definition_cmd: (binding * string option * mixfix) option ->
        (binding * string option * mixfix) list -> string list -> Attrib.binding * string ->
         bool -> local_theory -> (term * (string * thm)) * local_theory
  val _= axiomatization: (binding * typ option * mixfix) list ->
        (binding * typ option * mixfix) list -> term list ->
        (Attrib.binding * term) list -> theory -> (term list * thm list) * theory
  val _= axiomatization_cmd: (binding * string option * mixfix) list ->
        (binding * string option * mixfix) list -> string list ->
        (Attrib.binding * string) list -> theory -> (term list * thm list) * theory
  val _= axiom: Attrib.binding * term -> theory -> thm * theory
  val _= abbreviation: Syntax.mode -> (binding * typ option * mixfix) option ->
        (binding * typ option * mixfix) list -> term -> bool -> local_theory -> local_theory
  val _= abbreviation_cmd: Syntax.mode -> (binding * string option * mixfix) option ->
        (binding * string option * mixfix) list -> string -> bool -> local_theory -> local_theory
in val _ = () end
\<close>

text\<open>Note that the interface is mostly based on @{ML_type "local_theory"}, which is a synonym to
@{ML_type "Proof.context"}. Need to lift this to a global system transition ?
Don't worry, @{ML "Named_Target.theory_map: (local_theory -> local_theory) -> theory -> theory"} 
does the trick.

section*[t24::technical]\<open>Backward Proofs: Tactics, Tacticals and Goal-States\<close>

text\<open>At this point, we leave the Pure-Kernel and start to describe the first layer on top
  of it, involving support for specific styles of reasoning and automation of reasoning.\<close>

text\<open> \<^verbatim>\<open>tactic\<close>'s are in principle \<^emph>\<open>relations\<close> on theorems @{ML_type "thm"}; this gives a natural way 
  to represent the fact that HO-Unification (and therefore the mechanism of rule-instantiation) 
  are non-deterministic in principle. Heuristics may choose particular preferences between 
  the theorems in the range of this relation, but the Isabelle Design accepts this fundamental 
  fact reflected at this point in the prover architecture. 
  This potentially infinite relation is implemented by a function of theorems to lazy lists 
  over theorems, which gives both sufficient structure for heuristic
  considerations as well as a nice algebra, called  \<^verbatim>\<open>TACTICAL\<close>'s, providing a bottom element
  @{ML "no_tac"} (the function that always fails), the top-element @{ML "all_tac"}
   (the function that never fails), sequential composition @{ML "op THEN"}, (serialized) 
  non-deterministic composition @{ML "op ORELSE"}, conditionals, repetitions over lists, etc.
  The following is an excerpt of @{file "~~/src/Pure/tactical.ML"}:\<close>

ML\<open>
signature TACTICAL =
sig
  type tactic = thm -> thm Seq.seq

  val all_tac: tactic
  val no_tac: tactic
  val COND: (thm -> bool) -> tactic -> tactic -> tactic

  val THEN: tactic * tactic -> tactic
  val ORELSE: tactic * tactic -> tactic
  val THEN': ('a -> tactic) * ('a -> tactic) -> 'a -> tactic
  val ORELSE': ('a -> tactic) * ('a -> tactic) -> 'a -> tactic

  val TRY: tactic -> tactic
  val EVERY: tactic list -> tactic
  val EVERY': ('a -> tactic) list -> 'a -> tactic
  val FIRST: tactic list -> tactic
  (* ... *)
end
\<close>

text\<open>The next layer in the architecture describes @{ML_type \<open>tactic\<close>}'s, i.e. basic operations on 
  theorems  in a backward reasoning style (bottom up development of proof-trees). An initial goal-state 
  for some property @{term A} --- the \<^emph>\<open>goal\<close> --- is constructed via the kernel 
  @{ML "Thm.trivial"}-operation into  @{term "A \<Longrightarrow> A"}, and tactics either refine the premises 
  --- the \<^emph>\<open>subgoals\<close> the of this meta-implication --- 
  producing more and more of them or eliminate them in subsequent goal-states. Subgoals of the form  
  @{term "B\<^sub>1 \<Longrightarrow> B\<^sub>2 \<Longrightarrow> A \<Longrightarrow> B\<^sub>3 \<Longrightarrow> B\<^sub>4 \<Longrightarrow> A"} can be eliminated via 
  the @{ML Tactic.assume_tac} - tactic, 
  and a subgoal @{term C\<^sub>m} can be refined via the theorem
  @{term "E\<^sub>1 \<Longrightarrow> E\<^sub>2 \<Longrightarrow> E\<^sub>3 \<Longrightarrow> C\<^sub>m"} the @{ML Tactic.resolve_tac} - tactic to new subgoals
  @{term "E\<^sub>1"},@{term "E\<^sub>2"}, @{term "E\<^sub>3"}. In case that a theorem used for resolution
  has no premise @{term "E\<^sub>i"}, the subgoal  @{term C\<^sub>m} is also eliminated ("closed").
  
  The following abstract of the most commonly used @{ML_type \<open>tactic\<close>}'s drawn from
  @{file "~~/src/Pure/tactic.ML"} looks as follows:\<close>

ML\<open>
  (* ... *)
  assume_tac: Proof.context -> int -> tactic;
  compose_tac: Proof.context -> (bool * thm * int) -> int -> tactic;
  resolve_tac: Proof.context -> thm list -> int -> tactic;
  eresolve_tac: Proof.context -> thm list -> int -> tactic;
  forward_tac: Proof.context -> thm list -> int -> tactic;
  dresolve_tac: Proof.context -> thm list -> int -> tactic;
  rotate_tac: int -> int -> tactic;
  defer_tac: int -> tactic;
  prefer_tac: int -> tactic;
  (* ... *)
\<close>
text\<open>Note that "applying a rule" is a fairly complex operation in the Extended Isabelle Kernel,
  i.e. the tactic layer. It involves at least four phases, interfacing a theorem 
  coming from the global context $\theta$ (=theory), be it axiom or derived, into a given goal-state.
\<^item> \<^emph>\<open>generalization\<close>. All free variables in the theorem were replaced by schematic variables.
  For example, @{term "x + y = y + x"} is converted into 
  @{emph \<open>?x + ?y = ?y + ?x\<close> }. 
  By the way, type variables were treated equally.
\<^item> \<^emph>\<open>lifting over assumptions\<close>. If a subgoal is of the form: 
  @{term "B\<^sub>1 \<Longrightarrow> B\<^sub>2 \<Longrightarrow> A"} and we have a theorem @{term "D\<^sub>1 \<Longrightarrow> D\<^sub>2 \<Longrightarrow> A"}, then before
  applying the theorem, the premisses were \<^emph>\<open>lifted\<close> resulting in the logical refinement:
  @{term "(B\<^sub>1 \<Longrightarrow> B\<^sub>2 \<Longrightarrow> D\<^sub>1) \<Longrightarrow> (B\<^sub>1 \<Longrightarrow> B\<^sub>2 \<Longrightarrow> D\<^sub>2) \<Longrightarrow> A"}. Now, @{ML "resolve_tac"}, for example,
  will replace the subgoal @{term "B\<^sub>1 \<Longrightarrow> B\<^sub>2 \<Longrightarrow> A"} by the subgoals 
  @{term "B\<^sub>1 \<Longrightarrow> B\<^sub>2 \<Longrightarrow> D\<^sub>1"}  and  @{term "B\<^sub>1 \<Longrightarrow> B\<^sub>2 \<Longrightarrow> D\<^sub>2"}. Of course, if the theorem wouldn't
  have assumptions @{term "D\<^sub>1"} and @{term "D\<^sub>2"}, the subgoal @{term "A"} would be replaced by 
  \<^bold>\<open>nothing\<close>, i.e. deleted.
\<^item> \<^emph>\<open>lifting over parameters\<close>. If a subgoal is meta-quantified like in:
  @{term "\<And> x y z. A x y z"}, then a theorem like  @{term "D\<^sub>1 \<Longrightarrow> D\<^sub>2 \<Longrightarrow> A"} is \<^emph>\<open>lifted\<close>  
  to @{term "\<And> x y z. D\<^sub>1' \<Longrightarrow> D\<^sub>2' \<Longrightarrow> A'"}, too. Since free variables occurring in @{term "D\<^sub>1"}, 
  @{term "D\<^sub>2"} and @{term "A"} have been replaced by schematic variables (see phase one),
  they must be replaced by parameterized schematic variables, i. e. a kind of skolem function.
  For example, @{emph \<open>?x + ?y = ?y + ?x\<close> } would be lifted to 
  @{emph \<open>!!  x y z. ?x x y z + ?y x y z = ?y x y z + ?x x y z\<close>}. This way, the lifted theorem
  can be instantiated by the parameters  @{term "x y z"} representing "fresh free variables"
  used for this sub-proof. This mechanism implements their logically correct bookkeeping via
  kernel primitives.
\<^item> \<^emph>\<open>Higher-order unification (of schematic type and term variables)\<close>.
  Finally, for all these schematic variables, a solution must be found.
  In the case of @{ML resolve_tac}, the conclusion of the (doubly lifted) theorem must
  be equal to the conclusion of the subgoal, so @{term A} must be $\alpha/\beta$-equivalent to
  @{term A'} in the example above, which is established by a higher-order unification
  process. It is a bit unfortunate that for implementation efficiency reasons, a very substantial
  part of the code for HO-unification is in the kernel module @{ML_type "thm"}, which makes this
  critical component of the architecture larger than necessary.

  command section and bind its syntax and semantics at a specific keyword.

  creates an implicit  @{ML Theory.setup}  with an entry for a call-back function, which happens
  to be a parser that must have as side-effect a Toplevel-transition-transition.

chapter*[frontend::technical]\<open>Front-End \<close>  
text\<open>In the following chapter, we turn to the right part of the system architecture 
  shown in @{docitem \<open>architecture\<close>}: 
  The PIDE ("Prover-IDE") layer @{cite "DBLP:conf/itp/Wenzel14"}
  consisting of a part written in SML and another in SCALA.
  Roughly speaking, PIDE implements "continuous build - continuous check" - functionality
  over a textual, albeit generic document model. It transforms user modifications
  of text elements in an instance of this model into increments (edits) and communicates
  them to the Isabelle system. The latter reacts by the creation of a multitude of light-weight
  reevaluation threads resulting in an asynchronous stream of markup that is used to annotate text
  elements. Such markup is used to highlight, e.g., variables
  or keywords with specific colors, to hyper-linking bound variables to their defining occurrences,
  or to annotate type-information to terms which becomes displayed by specific
  user-gestures on demand (hovering), etc. 
  Note that PIDE is not an editor, it is the framework that 
  coordinates these asynchronous information streams and optimizes it to a certain
  extent (outdated markup referring to modified text is dropped, and 
  corresponding re-calculations are oriented to the user focus, for example). 
  Four concrete editors --- also called PIDE applications --- have been implemented:
\<^enum> an Eclipse plugin (developped by an Edinburg-group, based on an very old PIDE version),
\<^enum> a Visual-Studio Code plugin (developed by Makarius Wenzel), 
  currently based on a fairly old PIDE version, 
\<^enum> clide, a web-client supporting javascript and HTML5
  (developed by a group at University Bremen, based on a very old PIDE version), and 
\<^enum> the most commonly used: the plugin in JEdit - Editor,
  (developed by Makarius Wenzel, current PIDE version.)\<close>

text\<open>The document model forsees a number of text files, which are organized in form of an 
  acyclic graph. Such graphs can be grouped into \<^emph>\<open>sessions\<close> and "frozen" to binaries in order 
  to avoid long compilation times. Text files have an abstract name serving as identity (the 
  mapping to file-paths in an underlying file-system is done in an own build management).
  The primary format of the text files is \<^verbatim>\<open>.thy\<close> (historically for: theory),
  secondary formats can be \<^verbatim>\<open>.sty\<close>,\<^verbatim>\<open>.tex\<close>, \<^verbatim>\<open>.png\<close>, \<^verbatim>\<open>.pdf\<close>, or other files processed 
  by Isabelle and listed in a configuration processed by the build system.\<close>

        \<open>A Theory-Graph in the Document Model\<close>

text\<open>A \<^verbatim>\<open>.thy\<close> file consists of a \<^emph>\<open>header\<close>, a \<^emph>\<open>context-definition\<close> and
  a \<^emph>\<open>body\<close> consisting of a sequence of \<^emph>\<open>commands\<close>. Even the header consists of
  a sequence of commands used for introductory text elements not depending on any context
  information (so: practically excluding any form of text antiquotation (see above)).
  The context-definition contains an \<^emph>\<open>import\<close> and a \<^emph>\<open>keyword\<close> section;  
  for example:
  \begin{verbatim}
  theory Isa_DOF                (* Isabelle Document Ontology Framework *)
    imports  Main  
             RegExpInterface    (* Interface to functional regular automata for monitoring *)
             Assert
             
    keywords "+=" ":=" "accepts" "rejects"
  \end{verbatim}
  where \<^verbatim>\<open>Isa_DOF\<close> is the abstract name of the text-file, \<^verbatim>\<open>Main\<close> etc. refer to imported
  text files (recall that the import relation must be acyclic). \<^emph>\<open>keyword\<close>s are used to separate 
  commands form each other;
  predefined commands allow for the dynamic creation of new commands similarly 
  to the definition of new functions in an interpreter shell (or: toplevel, see above.).
  A command starts with a pre-declared keyword and specific syntax of this command;
  the declaration of a keyword is only allowed in the same \<^verbatim>\<open>.thy\<close>-file where the
  the corresponding new command is defined. The semantics of the command is expressed
  in ML and consists of a @{ML_type "Toplevel.transition -> Toplevel.transition"}
  function. Thus, the Isar-toplevel supports the generic document model 
  and allows for user-programmed extensions.\<close>

text\<open>In the traditional literature, Isabelle \<^verbatim>\<open>.thy\<close>-files were 
  were said to be processed by processed by two types of parsers:
\<^enum> the "outer-syntax" (i.e. the syntax for commands) is processed 
  by a lexer-library and parser combinators built on top, and
\<^enum> the "inner-syntax" (i.e. the syntax for @{term \<open>\<Lambda>\<close>} - terms) 
  with an evolved, eight-layer parsing and pretty-printing process
  based on an Early-algorithm.
\<close>

text\<open>This picture is less and less true for a number of reasons:
\<^enum> With the advent of \<open>(\<open>)... (\<close>)\<close>, a mechanism for
  \<^emph>\<open>cascade-syntax\<close> came to the Isabelle platform that introduce a flexible means
  to change parsing contexts \<^emph>\<open>and\<close> parsing technologies. 
\<^enum> Inside the term-parser levels, the concept of \<^emph>\<open>cartouche\<close> can be used 
  to escape the parser and its underlying parsing technology.
\<^enum> Outside, in the traditional toplevel-parsers, the 
  \<open>(\<open>)... (\<close>)\<close> is becoming more and more enforced
  (some years ago, syntax like \<open>term{* ... *}\<close> was replaced by 
   syntax \<open>term(\<open>)... (\<close>)\<close>. This makes technical support of cascade syntax
   more and more easy.
\<^enum> The Lexer infra-structure is already rather generic; nothing prevents to
  add beside the lexer - configurations for ML-Parsers, Toplevel Command Syntax 
  parsers, mathematical notation parsers for $\lambda$-terms new pillars
  of parsing technologies, say, for parsing C or Rust or JavaScript inside 
  Isabelle.

text\<open>@{ML_type "string"} is the basic library type from the SML library

text\<open>The structures @{ML_structure Markup} and @{ML_structure Properties} represent the basic

  the serialized, textual presentation of the protocol. Markups are structurally a pair of a key
  and properties; @{ML_structure Markup} provides a number of of such \<^emph>\<open>key\<close>s for annotation classes
  such as "constant", "fixed", "cartouche", some of them quite obscure. Here is a code sample

section\<open> Combinator Parsing \<close>  
text\<open>Parsing Combinators go back to monadic programming as advocated by Wadler et. al, and has been 
  worked out @{cite "DBLP:journals/jfp/Hutton92"}. Parsing combinators are one of the two
  major parsing technologies of the Isabelle front-end, in particular for the outer-syntax used
  for the parsing of toplevel-commands. The core of the combinator library is 
  @{ML_structure \<open>Scan\<close>} providing the @{ML_type "'a parser"} which is a synonym for
  @{ML_type " Token.T list -> 'a * Token.T list"}. 
  
   "parsers" are actually  interpreters; an 'a parser is a function that parses
  an input stream and computes(=evaluates, computes) it into 'a. 
  Since the semantics of an Isabelle command is a transition => transition 
  or theory $\Rightarrow$ theory  function, i.e. a global system transition.
  parsers of that type can be constructed and be bound as call-back functions
  to a table in the Toplevel-structure of Isar.
  
  The library also provides a bunch of infix parsing combinators, notably:\<close>

ML\<open>
  val _ = op !! : ('a * message option -> message) -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b
               (*apply function*)
  val _ = op >> : ('a -> 'b * 'c) * ('b -> 'd) -> 'a -> 'd * 'c
  (*alternative*)
  val _ = op || : ('a -> 'b) * ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b
  (*sequential pairing*)
  val _ = op -- : ('a -> 'b * 'c) * ('c -> 'd * 'e) -> 'a -> ('b * 'd) * 'e
  (*dependent pairing*)
  val _ = op :-- : ('a -> 'b * 'c) * ('b -> 'c -> 'd * 'e) -> 'a -> ('b * 'd) * 'e
  (*projections*)
  val _ = op :|-- : ('a -> 'b * 'c) * ('b -> 'c -> 'd * 'e) -> 'a -> 'd * 'e
  val _ = op |-- : ('a -> 'b * 'c) * ('c -> 'd * 'e) -> 'a -> 'd * 'e
  val _ = op --| : ('a -> 'b * 'c) * ('c -> 'd * 'e) -> 'a -> 'b * 'e
  (*concatenation*)
  val _ = op ^^ : ('a -> string * 'b) * ('b -> string * 'c) -> 'a -> string * 'c
  val _ = op ::: : ('a -> 'b * 'c) * ('c -> 'b list * 'd) -> 'a -> 'b list * 'd
  val _ = op @@@ : ('a -> 'b list * 'c) * ('c -> 'b list * 'd) -> 'a -> 'b list * 'd
  (*one element literal*)
  val _ = op $$ : string -> string list -> string * string list
  val _ = op ~$$ : string -> string list -> string * string list
 \<close>

text\<open>Usually, combinators were used in one of these following instances:\<close>

ML\<open>

  type 'a parser = Token.T list -> 'a * Token.T list
  type 'a context_parser = Context.generic * Token.T list -> 'a * (Context.generic * Token.T list)


(* conversion between these two : *)

fun parser2contextparser pars (ctxt, toks) = let val (a, toks') = pars toks
                                             in  (a,(ctxt, toks')) end;
val _ = parser2contextparser : 'a parser -> 'a context_parser;

(* bah, is the same as Scan.lift *)
val _ = Scan.lift Args.cartouche_input : Input.source context_parser;\<close>

subsection\<open>Advanced Parser Library\<close>

text\<open>There are two parts. A general multi-purpose parsing combinator library is 
  found under @{ML_structure "Parse"}, providing basic functionality for parsing strings
  or integers. There is also an important combinator that reads the current position information
  out of the input stream:\<close>
ML\<open>
Parse.nat: int parser;  
Parse.int: int parser;
Parse.enum_positions: string -> 'a parser -> ('a list * Position.T list) parser;
Parse.enum: string -> 'a parser -> 'a list parser;
Parse.input: 'a parser -> Input.source parser;

Parse.enum : string -> 'a parser -> 'a list parser;
Parse.!!! : (Token.T list -> 'a) -> Token.T list -> 'a;
Parse.position: 'a parser -> ('a * Position.T) parser;

(* Examples *)                                     
Parse.position Args.cartouche_input;
\<close>

text\<open>The second part is much more high-level, and can be found under @{ML_structure Args}.
  In parts, these combinators are again based on more low-level combinators, in parts they serve as 
  an an interface to the underlying Earley-parser for mathematical notation used in types and terms.
  This is perhaps meant with the fairly cryptic comment:
  "Quasi-inner syntax based on outer tokens: concrete argument syntax of
  attributes, methods etc." at the beginning of this structure.\<close>

subsection\<open> Bindings \<close>  

text\<open> The structure @{ML_structure "Binding"} serves as 
  \<open>structured name bindings\<close>, as says the description, i.e. a mechanism to basically 
  associate an input string-fragment to its position. This concept is vital in all parsing processes
  and the interaction with PIDE.

  Key are two things:
\<^enum> the type-synonym @{ML_type "bstring"} which is synonym to @{ML_type "string"}
  and intended for "primitive names to be bound"
\<^enum> the projection @{ML "Binding.pos_of :  binding -> Position.T"} 
\<^enum> the constructor establishing a binding @{ML "Binding.make: bstring * Position.T -> binding"}

\<close>

text\<open>Since this is so common in interface programming, there are a number of antiquotations\<close>
ML\<open>
val H = @{binding here}; (* There are "bindings" consisting of a text-span and a position, 
                            where \<dieresis>positions\<dieresis> are absolute references to a file *)                                  

Binding.pos_of H;  (* clicking on "H" activates the hyperlink to the defining occ of "H" above *)

  hooks (this can be confusing at times). Main phases of inner syntax processing, with standard

text\<open> This interactive Isabelle Programming Cook-Book represents my current way 
  to view and explain Isabelle programming API's to students and collaborators. 
  It differs from the reference  manual in some places on purpose, since I believe 
  that a lot of internal Isabelle API's need a more conceptual view on what is happening 
  (even if this conceptual view is at times over-abstracting a little).
  It also offers a deliberately different abstraction  to the explanations in form of comments
  in the sources or in the Reference Manual.
  
  The descriptions of some sources may appear lengthy and repetitive and redundant - but this kind 
  of repetition not only give an idea of the chosen abstraction levels on some interfaces, but also
  represents --- since this is a "living document" (a notion I owe Simon Foster) --- a continuous check
  for each port of our material to  each more recent Isabelle version, where the first attempts
  to load it will fail, but give another source of information over the modifications of
  the system interface for parts relevant to our own development work.
  
  All hints and contributions of collegues and collaborators are greatly welcomed; all errors
  and the roughness of this presentation is entirely my fault.

\<open> \<^isadof> provides an implementation of \<^dof> on top of Isabelle/HOL. 
  \<^dof> itself is a novel framework for \<^emph>\<open>defining\<close> ontologies
  and \<^emph>\<open>enforcing\<close> them during document development and document
  evolution. \<^isadof>  targets use-cases such as mathematical texts referring
  to a theory development or technical reports requiring a particular structure.
  A major application of \<^dof> is the integrated development of
  formal certification documents (\<^eg>, for Common Criteria or CENELEC
  50128) that require consistency across both formal and informal
  arguments. 

  \<^isadof> is integrated into Isabelle's IDE, which
  allows for smooth ontology development as well as immediate
  ontological feedback during the editing of a document.
  Its checking facilities leverage the collaborative 
  development of documents required to be consistent with an
  underlying ontological structure.
  
  In this user-manual, we give an in-depth presentation of the design
  concepts of \<^dof>'s Ontology Definition Language (ODL) and describe
  comprehensively its major commands. Many examples show typical best-practice
  applications of the system.

  It is an unique feature of  \<^isadof>  that ontologies may be used to control
  the link between formal and informal content in documents in a machine
  checked way. These links can connect both text elements as well as formal
  modelling elements such as terms, definitions, code  and logical formulas,
  alltogether *\<open>integrated\<close> in a state-of-the-art interactive theorem prover.

While Isabelle is mostly known as part of Isabelle/HOL (an interactive 
theorem prover), it actually provides a framework for developing a wide
spectrum of applications. A particular strength
of the Isabelle framework is the combination of text editing, formal verification,
and code generation. 

Up to now, Isabelle's document preparation system lacks a mechanism
for ensuring the structure of different document types (as, e.g.,
required in certification processes) in general and, in particular,
mechanism for linking informal and formal parts of a document. 

In this paper, we present \isadof, a novel Document Ontology Framework 
on top of Isabelle. \isadof allows for conventional typesetting
\<^emph>\<open>as well\<close> as formal development. We show how to model document
 ontologies inside \isadof, how to use the resulting meta-information 
for enforcing a certain document structure, and discuss ontology-specific IDE support.

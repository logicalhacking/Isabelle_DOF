  abstract      = {We present the generic system framework of
                  Isabelle/Isarunderlying recent versions of Isabelle. Among
                  other things, Isar provides an infrastructure for Isabelle
                  plug-ins, comprising extensible state components and
                  extensible syntax that can be bound to tactical ML
                  programs. Thus the Isabelle/Isar architecture may be
                  understood as an extension and refinement of the
                  traditional LCF approach, with explicit infrastructure for
                  building derivative systems. To demonstrate the technical
                  potential of the framework, we apply it to a concrete
                  formalmethods tool: the HOL-Z 3.0 environment, which is
                  geared towards the analysis of Z specifications and formal
                  proof of forward-refinements.},

                  users rather than a monograph for researchers. The book has
                  three parts.

                  1. Elementary Techniques shows how to model functional
                  programs in higher-order logic. Early examples involve
                  lists and the natural numbers. Most proofs are two steps
                  long, consisting of induction on a chosen variable followed
                  by the auto tactic. But even this elementary part covers
                  such advanced topics as nested and mutual recursion. 2.
                  Logic and Sets presents a collection of lower-level tactics
                  that you can use to apply rules selectively. It also
                  describes Isabelle/\acs{hol}'s treatment of sets, functions
                  and relations and explains how to define sets inductively.
                  One of the examples concerns the theory of model checking,
                  and another is drawn from a classic textbook on formal
                  languages. 3. Advanced Material describes a variety of
                  other topics. Among these are the real numbers, records and
                  overloading. Advanced techniques are described involving
                  induction and recursion. A whole chapter is devoted to an
                  extended example: the verification of a security protocol. },

  abstract	= { Historically, the LCF tradition of interactive theorem
		  proving was tied to the read-eval-print loop, with
		  sequential and synchronous evaluation of prover commands
		  given on the command-line. This user-interface technology
		  was adequate when R. Milner introduced his LCF proof
		  assistant in the 1970-ies, but it severely limits the
		  potential of current multicore hardware and advanced IDE
		  front-ends.
		  
		  Isabelle/PIDE breaks this loop and retrofits the
		  read-eval-print phases into an asynchronous model of
		  document-oriented proof processing. Instead of feeding a
		  sequence of individual commands into the prover process,
		  the primary interface works via edits over a family of
		  document versions. Execution is implicit and managed by the
		  prover on its own account in a timeless and stateless
		  manner. Various aspects of interactive proof checking are
		  scheduled according to requirements determined by the
		  front-end perspective on the proof document, while making
		  adequate use of the CPU resources on multicore hardware on
		  the back-end.
		  
		  Recent refinements of Isabelle/PIDE provide an explicit
		  concept of asynchronous print functions over existing proof
		  states. This allows to integrate long-running or
		  potentially non-terminating tools into the document-model.
		  Applications range from traditional proof state output
		  (which may consume substantial time in interactive
		  development) to automated provers and dis-provers that
		  report on existing proof document content (e.g.
		  Sledgehammer, Nitpick, Quickcheck in Isabelle/HOL).
		  Moreover, it is possible to integrate query operations via
		  additional GUI panels with separate input and output (e.g.
		  for Sledgehammer or find-theorems). Thus the Prover IDE
		  provides continuous proof processing, augmented by add-on
		  tools that help the user to continue writing proofs.

		  The process adheres to the objectives of an ``agile

		  continuous improvement. Yet, it enforces the overall
		  coherence of the development artifacts (ranging from proofs
		  over tests to code) by a particular environment (CVCE).
		  
		  In particular, the validation process is built around a
		  formal development based on the interactive theorem proving
		  system Isabelle/HOL, by linking the business logic of the
		  application to the operating system model, down to code and
		  concrete hardware models thanks to a series of refinement
		  proofs.
		  
		  We apply both the process and its support in CVCE to a

  abstract = {DOF is a novel framework for \emph{defining} ontologies and
  \emph{enforcing} them during document development and document
  evolution. A major goal of DOF is the integrated development of
  formal certification documents (\eg, for Common Criteria or CENELEC
  50128) that require consistency across both formal and informal
  arguments.

  To support a consistent development of formal and informal parts of
  a document, we provide Isabelle/DOF, an implementation of DOF on top of
  Isabelle/HOL.  \isadof is integrated into Isabelle's IDE, which
  allows for smooth ontology development as well as immediate
  ontological feedback during the editing of a document.

  In this paper, we give an in-depth presentation of the design
  concepts of DOF's Ontology Definition Language (ODL) and key
  aspects of the technology of its implementation.  \isadof is the
  first ontology language supporting machine-checked
  links between the formal and informal parts in an LCF-style
  interactive theorem proving environment.

  Sufficiently annotated, large documents can easily be developed
  collaboratively, while \emph{ensuring their consistency}, and the
  impact of changes (in the formal and the semi-formal content) is
  tracked automatically.},

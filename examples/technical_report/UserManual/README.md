# Intro
During my third year at Universite Paris-Saclay, I did a TER (Travail d'Etude et de Recherche, or a study and research project) at the Laboratoire de méthodes formelles (LMF).
My task was to write a user manual for the langage Isabelle/DOF, which provides a document ontology framework on top of Isabelle/HOL.
